# Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)
Welcome to the Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) repository! This project aims to develop a robust and scalable platform leveraging machine learning techniques for threat detection and analysis. The repository contains datasets for training and testing the TIP model, along with an IPython notebook for threat detection.

# Datasets
The datasets directory contains the following datasets:

### `train_data.csv`
This CSV file contains the training data for the TIP model. It includes labeled examples of various cyber threats for model training.
### `test_data.csv` 
This CSV file contains the testing data for evaluating the performance of the TIP model. It includes unlabeled examples of potential threats for model testing.

# Threat Detection IPython Notebook
The **`CS.ipynb`** notebook is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the trained TIP model to detect threats in real-time data. It provides step-by-step instructions and code examples for loading the model, preprocessing the data, and making predictions on new data.

# Usage
To use the datasets and IPython notebook in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to the datasets directory and explore the training and testing datasets.
Open the **CS.ipynb** notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and detect threats using the TIP model.

# Requirements
To run the IPython notebook and work with the datasets, you will need the following dependencies:

### `Python (version >= 3.6)`
### `Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab`
### `Pandas`
### `NumPy`
### `Scikit-learn`
### `Matplotlib`
### `Seaborn`
You can install the required dependencies using pip or conda package managers.
